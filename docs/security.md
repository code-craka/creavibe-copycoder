# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in our Next.js application to protect user data and prevent common web vulnerabilities.

## Security Measures

### 1. Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)

All database tables have Row Level Security enabled to ensure users can only access their own data.

#### Implementation

- Each table has RLS policies that filter by `user_id`
- All data access is restricted based on the authenticated user's ID
- Server-side validation is performed in addition to RLS as a defense-in-depth measure

#### Example Policy

\`\`\`sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can only view their own projects" 
ON projects FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
\`\`\`

### 2. CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is configured to restrict which domains can access our API endpoints.

#### Implementation

- Allowed origins are explicitly specified
- Only necessary HTTP methods are allowed
- Appropriate headers are set for security

### 3. HTTP Security Headers

Security headers are implemented via middleware to enhance protection against common web vulnerabilities.

#### Implementation

- Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks
- X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME type sniffing
- X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- Referrer-Policy to control referrer information
- Permissions-Policy to control feature usage
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS

### 4. Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse and brute force attacks.

#### Implementation

- Limits are set on the number of requests from a single IP or user
- Different limits for authenticated vs. unauthenticated users
- More restrictive limits for sensitive endpoints (e.g., authentication)

### 5. Resource Ownership Validation

All data access includes validation to ensure users can only access their own resources.

#### Implementation

- Helper functions verify resource ownership before operations
- Double-checking ownership even when RLS is in place (defense in depth)
- Generic error messages to avoid information disclosure

### 6. User Consent Management

A comprehensive system for managing user consents in compliance with privacy regulations.

#### Implementation

- Database table to store user consents with versioning
- UI for gathering and updating consent
- Verification before processing user data

### 7. Cookie Consent

A cookie consent banner that allows users to control what cookies are used.

#### Implementation

- Banner with options for different cookie types
- Preferences stored and respected
- Analytics disabled unless consent is given

### 8. CSRF Protection

Protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

#### Implementation

- CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests
- Token validation in middleware
- Secure cookie settings

### 9. Authentication Security

Secure authentication implementation.

#### Implementation

- Secure session handling
- Session timeout for inactive users
- Protection against brute force attacks

### 10. Error Handling

Secure error handling to prevent information disclosure.

#### Implementation

- Generic error messages for users
- Detailed logging for debugging (without sensitive data)
- Custom error pages

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure all items in the [security checklist](./security-checklist.md) are completed.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing security@example.com. Do not disclose security issues publicly until they have been handled by the security team.

## Regular Security Audits

We conduct regular security audits using automated tools and manual review. The last audit was performed on [DATE].
